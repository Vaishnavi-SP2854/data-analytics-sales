# Data Analytics – Sales Analysis Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing business sales data to uncover meaningful
insights that can help organizations make data-driven decisions.
The analysis is performed using Python and documented in a Jupyter Notebook.

The project examines revenue distribution, product performance, customer value,
and regional contribution to identify growth opportunities and business risks.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Identify top revenue-generating products
- Analyze revenue contribution by region (country)
- Discover high-value customers
- Understand revenue concentration across products and customers
- Provide actionable business recommendations

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas** – data manipulation and analysis
- **Matplotlib** – data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Git & GitHub** – version control

## 📂 Dataset Description
The dataset contains transactional sales records with the following key fields:

- `InvoiceNo` – Unique invoice number
- `StockCode` – Product identifier
- `Description` – Product name
- `Quantity` – Number of units sold
- `UnitPrice` – Price per unit
- `CustomerID` – Customer identifier
- `Country` – Sales region
- `Revenue` – Total revenue per transaction

> Note: The dataset does not contain a time-based column, so analysis focuses
on revenue distribution rather than time-series trends.

## 📊 Analysis Workflow
The project is structured into four main stages:

### Day 1: Data Understanding & Preparation
- Loaded and explored the dataset
- Cleaned column names
- Verified data types and structure
- Ensured revenue availability for analysis

### Day 2: Revenue Distribution Analysis
- Evaluated overall revenue contribution
- Analyzed revenue spread across products and regions

### Day 3: Product, Customer & Regional Performance
- Identified top revenue-generating products
- Analyzed regional (country-wise) revenue performance
- Identified high-value customers
- Compared quantity sold vs revenue generated

### Day 4: Business Insights & Recommendations
- Calculated key business metrics
- Applied Pareto (80/20) analysis on products
- Assessed customer revenue concentration risk
- Provided strategic business recommendations

---

## 🔍 Key Insights
- A small percentage of products contribute a large share of total revenue.
- Certain regions generate significantly higher revenue than others.
- High-value customers play a critical role in overall business performance.
- Some products generate high revenue despite lower sales volume, indicating premium pricing.
- Revenue concentration among a few customers presents potential business risk.

---

## 💡 Business Recommendations
- Focus marketing and inventory efforts on top-performing products.
- Retain high-value customers through loyalty and engagement programs.
- Expand presence in high-performing regions.
- Diversify customer base to reduce dependency on a few customers.
- Review low-performing products for pricing or discontinuation strategies.
